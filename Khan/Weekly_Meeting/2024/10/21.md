### Transformer-based Time-series prediction (High Priority)
* [ ] Develop a transformer model to predict a time-series data. 
  * Check this [paper](./../../../Reference/Polymer%20paper.pdf)
  * Training data is located [here](./../../../../Khan/Polymer_Data/Transformer-based/).
  * Develop a Transformer-based model to predict strain based on temperature and stress. 
    * [x] Start with Feedforward Neural Network. Develop a FNN to predict strain based on temperature and stress.
    
      * 10-16 update: Worked on FNN. Evaluate model performance, predict the strain. Worked on refining the FNN. Added drop out, weight decay, batch normalization. 
      Tried deeper network and different neurons on each layer.

        * RMSE: 0.1648 and MAPE: 11.14% (In the polymer paper for FCNN: RMSE : 5.16 and MAPE: 4.27%)

    * [ ] Change FNN into Transformer.

    * 10-21 Update: Implemented a Transformer. It runs but gives Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.4627 and Mean ABsolute Percent Error (MAPE): 66.92%.

    * This is the graphic feature of all polymers
  * SMPs visualized
    * This is the sample code to visualize the polymer structures
* **Task**
  * [ ] Start with how to convert a polymer structure into GNN input. 
    * [ ] Find **a tutorial to learn how to train a GNN** (especially for GNN with Polymers).  

### CycleGAN Conference Paper (low priority): 
  * [ ] Write a conference paper (6 pages) for CycleGAN. Use DQN to prove that CycleGAN is working. Submit it to IEEE Southeast Con 2025 https://ieeesoutheastcon.org/. 

    * 10-14 Update: Completed the sim to real generation of simulated data. dimension is correct now. And the file has the necessary keys and the converted data are fine in my understanding.
    * 10-18 update: cycleGAN results
  * [ ] Combine convereted_u, converted_v, and converted_con to generate the dataset. 

  * 10-21 Update: Completed to convert sim to real.
