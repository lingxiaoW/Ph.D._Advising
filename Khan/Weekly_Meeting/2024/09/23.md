### CycleGAN
* DQN verificatio
  * [ ] Updated in 09-20: Summarize your current result. 
      * Collect robot trajectory files, images, and the table 
      * Save them into a folder
      * 09-20: Saved in a folder (trajectory images and the search time, travel distance and success rate)
  * [ ] DDPG Application
      * Make sure your DDPG code is correct
      * 09-24 update: I run the code and the result of reward plot and trajectory after training for 100 episodes:
      ![img](./../../../images/rewards_plot.png)
      ![img](./../../../images/result-2.png)
      * [ ] Check your robot action command is correct
        * Give a fixed action command and see robot trajectory
        * For instance, if t=0 s -> DDPG output is 0 degree; if t=20 s -> DDPG output is 45 degree; if t=40 s -> DDPG output is -45 degree.
        * 09-24 update: Result of these force action. going in the opposite direction. I put t=0, t=5, and t=10 s.

        * Give me the feedback before Tuesday (Sep. 24th)
        * 09-23 update: I was trying to generate the robot tyrajectory and also checking the DDPG code.
        * 09-24: Worked on DDPG code only, made some corrections. But still there is issue with the step function as we can see from the force actions trajectory. it is going opposite.
        * 09-25 update: (Give run ddpg with 5000 episode with sim-to-real-generated data)
