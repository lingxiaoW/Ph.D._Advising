### CycleGAN
* DQN verificatio
  * [ ] DDPG Application
      * Make sure your DDPG code is correct
      * 09-24 update: I run the code and the result of reward plot and trajectory after training for 100 episodes:
        * **09-25 LX Updated**: 
          * From the diagram, it can be seen that the robot remains at the plume location and refuses to move towards the source.

### Transformer-based Time-series prediction
* [ ] Develop a transformer model to predict a time-series data. 
  * [ ] Check this [paper](./../../../Reference/Polymer%20paper.pdf)
  * Training data is located [here](./../../../../Khan/Polymer_Data/Transformer-based/).
  * Develop a Transformer-based model to predict strain based on temperature and stress.
