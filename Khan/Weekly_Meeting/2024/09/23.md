### CycleGAN
* DQN verificatio
  * [ ] DDPG Application
      * Make sure your DDPG code is correct
      * 09-24 update: I run the code and the result of reward plot and trajectory after training for 100 episodes:
      * 09-26 update: All the action output is 1. what could be the possible reasons for that?

      * **09-26 LX Updated**: 
        * Write a conference paper (6 pages) for CycleGAN. Use DQN to prove that CycleGAN is working. Submit it to IEEE Southeast Con 2025 https://ieeesoutheastcon.org/. 


### Transformer-based Time-series prediction
* [ ] Develop a transformer model to predict a time-series data. 
  * [ ] Check this [paper](./../../../Reference/Polymer%20paper.pdf)
  * Training data is located [here](./../../../../Khan/Polymer_Data/Transformer-based/).

  * 09-25 update: Read the SMP paper and take notes. link: https://github.com/khanRmahmud/PaperNotes/blob/main/Paper%20Reading/Transformers/polymer_transformer.md
  * Develop a Transformer-based model to predict strain based on temperature and stress.
