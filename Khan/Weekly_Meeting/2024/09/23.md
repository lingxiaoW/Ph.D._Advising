### CycleGAN
* DQN verificatio
  * [ ] Updated in 09-20: Summarize your current result. 
      * Collect robot trajectory files, images, and the table 
      * Save them into a folder
      * 09-20: Saved in a folder (trajectory images and the search time, travel distance and success rate)
  * [ ] Update in 09-20: DDPG output [-1 1]  
      * Change the output into 1 variable [-1 1] -> heading command
      * -1 -> -90 degree; 1 -> 90
      * if the output is 0 -> 0 degree
      * heading command = current heading + DDPG output
      * newx = oldx + cos(heading command); newy = oldy + sin(heading command)
