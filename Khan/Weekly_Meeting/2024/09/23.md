### CycleGAN
* DQN verificatio
  * [x] Updated in 09-20: Summarize your current result. 
      * Collect robot trajectory files, images, and the table 
      * Save them into a folder
      * 09-20: Saved in a folder (trajectory images and the search time, travel distance and success rate)
  * [ ] DDPG Application
      * Make sure your DDPG code is correct
      * [ ] Check your robot action command is correct
        * Give a fixed action command and see robot trajectory
        * For instance, if t=0 s -> DDPG output is 0 degree; if t=20 s -> DDPG output is 45 degree; if t=40 s -> DDPG output is -45 degree. 
        * Give me the feedback before Tuesday (Sep. 24th)

### Transformer-based Time-series prediction
* [ ] Develop a transformer model to predict a time-series data. 
  * [ ] Check this [paper](./../../../Reference/Polymer%20paper.pdf)
  * Training data is located [here](./../../../../Khan/Polymer_Data/).
  * Develop a Transformer-based model to predict strain based on temperature and stress. 
  * Give me the feedback before next week. 


### Graphic Neural Network-based Polymer Prediction
* [ ] Need the data from Diego for GNN
