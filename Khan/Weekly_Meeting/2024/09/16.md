### CycleGAN
* DQN verification
  * Train a DQN with generated_real_images
  * Train another DQN with simulated_images
  * Compare these two DQNs in real-world plume data (PIV image)
    * Averaged search time, success rate, travel distance.
    * You can try flip real-world plume data. 
    * Expectation: the DQN trained with generated_real_images should be better than Simulated_images
    * Another try: DDPG - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
* Paper writing
  * Sim-to-real gap
    * 09-16: blalala
  * In OSL problem, sim-to-real gap is in plume data -> our solution is CycleGAN
  * How to approve CycleGAN is valid? Use DQN
 
* Desktop setup
  * Connect the desktop (with GPU) with a monitor, mouse, keyboard.
  * Ask IT to setup a remote control in your desktop.
  * Use the desktop (with GPU) for training.
