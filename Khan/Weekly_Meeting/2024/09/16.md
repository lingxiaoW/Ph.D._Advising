### CycleGAN
* DQN verification
  * Train a DQN with generated_real_images
  * Train another DQN with simulated_images
  * Compare these two DQNs in real-world plume data (PIV image)
    * Averaged search time, success rate, travel distance.
    * You can try flip real-world plume data. 
    * Expectation: the DQN trained with generated_real_images should be better than Simulated_images
    * Another try: DDPG - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
* Paper writing
  * Sim-to-real gap
    * 09-16: blalala
  * In OSL problem, sim-to-real gap is in plume data -> our solution is CycleGAN
  * How to approve CycleGAN is valid? Use DQN
 
* Desktop setup
  * Connect the desktop (with GPU) with a monitor, mouse, keyboard.
  * Ask IT to setup a remote control in your desktop.
  * Use the desktop (with GPU) for training. 


### LX Updated
* Your current contract ends up at **June 30, 2025**, under the support of a one-year project. If I don't bring new research money before **June 30, 2025**, I don't have the money to support you anymore. 
  
* Bringing research money is not one-man job. You need to work as hard as I am. You cannot enjoy your day while I spin like a spinning top. You need to complete **the assigned research tasks fast**, so that I can write proposals to bring new research money. 

* Learning is self-motivated. Nobody will pay you to learn.
