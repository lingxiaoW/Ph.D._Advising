### CycleGAN -> Paper
* [ ] DDPG Application (middle priority)
  * Understand the theory behind DDPG, not just try the existing code. https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ddpg.html
  * [ ] Train the new code
    * Attach averaged reward plot here.

  * 09-30 update: Run the code but the results are not that we expected. SO I am trying to redefine the rewards and the action to scale down to [-0.5, 0.5], and the heading change is defined as scaled action x 45, so that the agent change its heading slowly.
        
### CycleGAN Conference Paper (low priority): 
  * [ ] Write a conference paper (6 pages) for CycleGAN. Use DQN to prove that CycleGAN is working. Submit it to IEEE Southeast Con 2025 https://ieeesoutheastcon.org/. 


### Transformer-based Time-series prediction (High Priority)
* [ ] Develop a transformer model to predict a time-series data. 
  * Check this [paper](./../../../Reference/Polymer%20paper.pdf)
  * Training data is located [here](./../../../../Khan/Polymer_Data/Transformer-based/).
  * Develop a Transformer-based model to predict strain based on temperature and stress. 
    * [ ] Start with Feedforward Neural Network. Develop a FNN to predict strain based on temperature and stress.
    * [ ] Change FNN into Transformer. 


### Graphic Neural Network-based Polymer Prediction (High Priority)
