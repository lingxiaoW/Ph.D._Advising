### Transformer-based Time-series prediction (High Priority)
* [x] Develop a transformer model to predict a time-series data. 
  * Check this [paper](./../../../Reference/Polymer%20paper.pdf)
  * Training data is located [here](./../../../../Khan/Polymer_Data/Transformer-based/).
  * Develop a Transformer-based model to predict strain based on temperature and stress. 
    * [x] Start with Feedforward Neural Network. Develop a FNN to predict strain based on temperature and stress.

        * RMSE: 0.1648 and MAPE: 11.14% (In the polymer paper for FCNN: RMSE : 5.16 and MAPE: 4.27%)

      * ...
    * autoDGEBA326-IPD
    * ...
  * SMILES for all SMPs
    * This is the graphic feature of all polymers
  * SMPs visualized
    * This is the sample code to visualize the polymer structures
* **Task**
  * [ ] Start with how to convert a polymer structure into GNN input. 

      * 10-28 Update: Worked on learning the epoxy and herdener reaction to make a durable solid structuire and how to represent these epoxy - hardener combination into graph using REDKIT and how to represent this graphs into vector using Pytorch geometric module and what could be the output from these geometric representations as an input to the GNN. 
      * 10-29 Update: Write a small function that converts the SMILE string into geometric data that can be used as INPUT to GNN.

      * 10-30 update: Worked on GNN model and how to train the model with the generated Geometric data and output the node embedding or graph embedding.
      * 10-31 update: Worked on DMPNN Directed Message Passing Neural Network, but dafec some issues with how to give input of two different sizes of polymer structure into the network.
    * [ ] Find **a tutorial to learn how to train a GNN** (especially for GNN with Polymers).  

    * 11-05 Update: Worked on how to concatenate two models to train the graph embedding and time series data and how to train these.

### CycleGAN Conference Paper (low priority): 
  * [ ] Write a conference paper (6 pages) for CycleGAN. Use DQN to prove that CycleGAN is working. Submit it to IEEE Southeast Con 2025 https://ieeesoutheastcon.org/.
