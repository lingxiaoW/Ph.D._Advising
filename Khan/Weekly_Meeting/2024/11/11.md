### Transformer-based Time-series prediction (High Priority)
* [x] Develop a transformer model to predict a time-series data. 
  * Check this [paper](./../../../Reference/Polymer%20paper.pdf)
  * Training data is located [here](./../../../../Khan/Polymer_Data/Transformer-based/).
  * Develop a Transformer-based model to predict strain based on temperature and stress. 
    * [x] Start with Feedforward Neural Network. Develop a FNN to predict strain based on temperature and stress.

        * RMSE: 0.1648 and MAPE: 11.14% (In the polymer paper for FCNN: RMSE : 5.16 and MAPE: 4.27%)

    - [ ] <span style="color:red">**NEW (11-11-2024)**</span>: Write a journal paper regarding the FNN, CNN, and Transformer-based time series prediction for polymer data. 
      - Journal paper link: https://www.mdpi.com/journal/information/special_issues/93P6E594J2#benefits
    * 11-14 update: worked on CNN for time series prediction. The result: RMSE .2955, MAPE 41.51% which is less accurate than the simple FNN.
    * 11-15 update: worked on CNN for time series prediction. Got RMSE : 0.0817, MAPE: 11.14%
                    worked on LSTM. I had implemented autoregressive LSTM previously and the result was : Test RMSE: 0.1438, Test MAPE: 14.13%.
                    now converting that into LSTM, which is on progress.
