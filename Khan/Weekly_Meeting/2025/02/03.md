#### Graphic Neural Network-based Polymer Prediction
* Graphic Neural Network Benchmark
  * Update Figure 1 in the manuscript
    * [x] Include W1 as a part of the input to the graphic transformer
  * Organize the code and result
    * [ ] Need the code to re-generate the reported result.


* **02-07**
  * [x] Make a more smooth moving average plot (increase the window size of moving average)
  
  * [ ] train a CNN on 10 csv files instead of 1 file see if the prediction result is good. 
    * Continuously train the model on 10 csv files
      * For each training, only split the csv file into training and validation
      * After the training, repeat the training with another csv file (don't initialize the model, import the saved model from the previous training). 
      * You can set an early stop signal here. If the model does not improve the accuarcy on validation data in 20 consecutive episodes, stop the training. 
      * You need to write a code to automate this process. 

* After training with 10 csv files from dataset 271:
  * Test RMSE: 1.2276, MAPE: 563.89%, Pearson Corr: 0.8267
