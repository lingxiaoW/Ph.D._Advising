#### Graphic Neural Network-based Polymer Prediction
* Graphic Neural Network Benchmark
  * Update Figure 1 in the manuscript
    * [ ] Include W1 as a part of the input to the graphic transformer
  * Organize the code and result
    * [ ] Need the code to re-generate the reported result.

* Prepare a larger training dataset
  * Continuously train the model on 10 csv files
    * For each training, only split the csv file into training and validation
    * After the training, repeat the training with another csv file (don't initialize the model, import the saved model from the previous training). 
    * You can set an early stop signal here. If the model does not improve the accuarcy on validation data in 20 consecutive episodes, stop the training. 
    * You need to write a code to automate this process. 
* Generate a Table:
