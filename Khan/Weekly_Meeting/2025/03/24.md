### Facial Expression Recognition
* Objective: Develop a CV model to classify human facial expresssions.
* Application: use this CV model in classroom to identify whether or not the student is engaged in the class. 

* Steps:
    * Check if there are existing papers which already do similar things (find some examples)
    * Answer these questions:
        * What facial expressions are -> Engaged (use papers to support this idea)
        * How do you tell a student is engaged, based on facial expresssion & gestures? 
        * How to develop this model (easy, find some existing DL models and dataset)
        * Once we have the model, try it with online student videos.
