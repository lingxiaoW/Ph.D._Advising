#### Semantic Vision and Olfaction-based Odor Source Localization
* **Goal**: design a navigation algorithm that uses semantic information of visual and olfactory information to deduce possible odor source location. 
* **TODO 02-22**:
  * [ ] **Step by Step Smenatic Analysis:**
    * Ask GPT to perform visual analysis, olfactory analysis, and obstacle analysis. 
    * A sample prompt is like this:
   
    ``` 
    Visual Analysis:
        Do you see an object that is a possible odor source for {the smell}?
        If yes, list the object's name. Choose the one that is most likely the odor source.
        If yes, and the front is obstacle free, move forward. 
    Olfactory Analysis: 
        If the sensed concentration decreases, turn back. 
        If the sensed concentration increases and front is obstacle free, move forward. 
    When the front is blocked:
        Turn to the side that is more likely to lead you to the possible odor source object.
    ```

  * [ ] **Adaptive Robot Speed**.
    * Calculate robot forward magnitude based on sensed concentration.
    * Try this:
    ```
    If concentration < 0.5:
        forward_magnitude = 1
    else:
        forward_magnitude = 0.3
    ```
    * Another way:
    ```
    min_con = 0
    max_con = 1.5
    forward_magnitude = map(0.3, 1, min_con, max_con)
    ```
