#### Semantic Vision and Olfaction-based Odor Source Localization
* **Goal**: design a navigation algorithm that uses semantic information of visual and olfactory information to deduce possible odor source location. 
* **Sample work**: Check this [paper](./../../../Reference/semantic_OSL.pdf) 

* **Related Works**:
  * Semantic Vision and Olfaction Fusion.
  * VirtualHome (or other in-door simulator) Env. and its applications with LLM.
  * Other multi-modal fusion algorithms (e.g., vision and audio fusion).

* **Steps**:
  * Indoor Simulation Env. (household env. [VirtualHome](http://virtual-home.org/))
      * Mainstream indoor simulator by other - e.g., Virtual home.
      * Get a list of indoor simulator with different rooms (e.g., bathroom, living room...) - just info with project link here.
        * 2 main

  * Vision branch: we need a vision branch to interpret surrounding objects to determine the room name (e.g., bathroom, living room, kitchen).

  * Real-world Env. with multiple odor source locations. 
* **Possible publications:**
  * Review/survey paper regarding multi-sensory fusion in robotics
