#### Sensor Paper
* [ ] Edit the sensor paper based on my comments
  * [ ] New experiments that use only vision and only olfaction are needed.
    * For vision-only, also use LLM to reason vision objects. But don't include olfactory-based navigation here. 
    * For olfaction-only, use moth-inspired method. 
    * Record experiments in video, record robot trajectories, search time, etc. And put them into the project page. 
    * Complete this before Wednesday Sep. 25th
  * [ ] Check all grammars, short-name usage, figure notations, etc. 
    * Have the draft ready to submit before Friday Sep. 27th. 



#### Deep Learning-based Aerosol Data Prediction
* [ ] Develop a deep learning model (FNN, CNN, and RNN) to predict aerosol data from polarimeter readings
  * Check this [reference paper](./../../../Reference/pacc-mapp_algorithm.pdf) first to get familiar with the background story. 
  * Training Data is located at here
  * Training Data includes:
    * pace325_train_set / pace325_test_set
    * pace318_train_set / pace318_test_set
    * For each data in the training set, it includes \['geometry', 'inputs', 'outputs'\], where 'geometry' can be treated as a special input, along with original inputs. 
    * The goal is to design a ML model to predict the outputs based on geometry and inputs.
