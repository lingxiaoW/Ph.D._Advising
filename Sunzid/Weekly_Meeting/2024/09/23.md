#### Sensor Paper
* [ ] Edit the sensor paper based on my comments
  * [ ] New experiments that use only vision and only olfaction are needed.
    * For vision-only, also use LLM to reason vision objects. But don't include olfactory-based navigation here. 
    * For olfaction-only, use moth-inspired method. 
    * Complete this before Wednesday
  * [ ] Check all grammars, short-name usage, figure notations, etc. 
    * Have the draft ready to submit before Friday.
