* **LX Update**: Attach the 22 output feature images to here. 
  * Notice, these images should include all testing points (you can use one testing file, such as pace318_test_set).
  * X axis is prediction; Y axis is true values. 

* 11-7: discarded past chatgpt written code and wrote new data processing and model training code. The new model performed better, uploaded real vs prediction graphs on 100 samples here. I'll train the model on entire data and generate output on entire data if the lab pc is not engaged.  
* 11 to 15-11: worked on writing review response.  


* 11-18 **LX Update**: FNN, CNN, and RNN prediction results

* 11-18 to 11-19: generated a non-linear model.

* 11-20: followed the Tutorial 2 code to add: dataloader, early stop, validation set. The paper used a $14\times1064\times1064\times1064\times24$ neural network with relu activations. In the lab desktop, $14\times64\times64\times64\times24$ can be trained with half the data ($14\times128\times128\times128\times24$ causes out of memory error). The results are still not similar to the target (graphs are in 20 Nov folder).  
* 11-21: trained 3 model variations (with epochs 5-10, LR 1e-2 to 1e-3, batch 64-128, final model 13X128X256X256X128X22) (outputs are in 21 Nov folder). Reducing learning rate resulted in better learning in small epoch sizes.  
* 11-22: trained model (13X128X256X256X128X22 for longer 40 epochs with lr 1e-4, batch 256). Used data from train folder that was not used in training to generate graphs (22 Nov).
 
#### Deep Learning-based Aerosol Data Prediction <span style="color:red">High Priority</span>
* [ ] Develop a deep learning model (FNN, CNN, and RNN) to predict aerosol data from polarimeter readings
  * Check this [reference paper](./../../../Reference/pacc-mapp_algorithm.pdf) first to get familiar with the background story. 
  * Training Data is located at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kr6PP44HHDL2HMxzoLwGjzfSOP5ZAmy1?usp=drive_link) 
  * Training Data includes:
    * pace325_train_set / pace325_test_set
    * pace318_train_set / pace318_test_set
    * For each data in the training set, it includes \['geometry', 'inputs', 'outputs'\], where 'geometry' can be treated as a special input, along with original inputs. 
    * The goal is to design a ML model to predict the outputs based on geometry and inputs. 


* **Task (Due on Oct. 11th) <span style="color:red">High Priority</span>** :
  * [x] Check this regression tutorials:
    * [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/christianversloot/machine-learning-articles/blob/main/how-to-create-a-neural-network-for-regression-with-pytorch.md)
    * [Tutorial 2](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1w61hXmpM_GNmuNmwkvPBeBTLB6HIy5_c?usp=sharing) 
 * FNN:
  * [ ] Generate the diagram of 22 output features: prediction vs ground truth the expected diagram is 45-degree line with slope 1.
  * [ ] Generate the diagram of 22 output features: use x axis as testing data point (0, 1, 2...), and y axis to show both prediction and ground truth with different colors (like the second graph).
  * [ ] If the result is not like that, change model architecture. Don't use the whole training data, use 50% to try model structures.
 * CNN/RNN
  * [ ] Treat data as time series. Search time series data prediction with CNN/RNN.
  * [ ] ![TensorFlow time series tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series)
  * [ ] Generate the diagram of 22 output features: prediction vs ground truth with expected slope=1

* This can be a conference paper to IEEE SoutheastCon (https://ieeesoutheastcon.org/)
  * The due date is Jan. 15th, 2025
